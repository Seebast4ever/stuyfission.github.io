                &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;FIRST Tech Challenge, or FTC, is a
                high school level competition originally designed to help
                bridge FIRST Lego League and FIRST Robotics Competition,
                allowing students to go from Legos to high level robotics more
                smoothly. But now, FTC has become its own competition. Building
                one and a half cube feet of robot is not as easy as it sounds.
                In September, teams all around the world pick up the game manual
                and start working. Given a set list of parts,teams are limited
                to use only certain materials for their robot,making the game
                harder and more challenging. Fitting mechanisms into the 18'
                cube isn't easy, but this is what thousands and thousands of
                high school teams do from September to March, in order to
                compete in one of the best competitions in the world, FIRST
                Tech Challenge.
