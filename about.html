                FIRST Tech Challenge, or FTC, is a high school level competition
                originally designed to help bridge FIRST Lego League and FIRST
                Robotics Competition, allowing students to go from Legos to high
                level robotics more smoothly. But now, FTC has become its own
                competition. Building one and a half cube feet of robot is not as
                easy as it sounds. In September, teams all around the world pick
                up the game manual and start working. Given a set list of parts,
                teams are limited to use only certain materials for their robot,
                making the game harder and more challenging. Fitting mechanisms
                into the 18' cube isn't easy, but this is what thousands and
                thousands of high school teams do from September to March, in
                order to compete in one of the best competitions in the world,
                FIRST Tech Challenge.

                I've always loved engineering, and I currently base my entire
                life around it. Not only have I been a member of my FTC team
                for 2 years, I have also mentored a total of three FLL teams
                in the last two years, and I plan to mentor 2-3 additional
                teams this coming year. I also build things on my free time,
                for myself and others. The amount of time, money, and effort
                I have put into engineering is astronomical compared to the
                time I've spent doing anything else. My biggest drive to
                continue working towards my engineering goals is that someday,
                I wish to spread the ideals of STEM to my community. The feeling
                you get when you make something all by yourself,  or design
                something that works is the best feeling in the world, and I want
                to share that with as many people as I can. When I was younger,
                I didn't have many opportunities to make things outside of
                arts and crafts, so I want to give others the opportunities that
                I wish I had. My other interests include piano, tennis, and not
                much other stuff.

                I joined robotics because of an interest in computer programming
                as a career and I wanted to challenge myself with the
                difficulties that robotics would present. From a young age,
                I've been extremely interested in the workings of computers and
                I enjoy tinkering with code in my free time. I enjoy the logical
                challenges presented by code and the engineering challenges
                presented by robotics. My other hobbies aside from robotics
                include playing basketball,
                <a href='http://na.leagueoflegends.com/'>League of Legends</a>,
                piano, and guitar. As head of programming for Stuy Fission 310,
                I am tasked with web design as well as robot programming and
                delegating programmers to do the same.
