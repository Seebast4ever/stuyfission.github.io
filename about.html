                &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;I've always loved engineering, and
                I currently base my entire
                life around it. Not only have I been a member of my FTC team
                for 2 years, I have also mentored a total of three FLL teams
                in the last two years, and I plan to mentor 2-3 additional
                teams this coming year. I also build things on my free time,
                for myself and others. The amount of time, money, and effort
                I have put into engineering is astronomical compared to the
                time I've spent doing anything else. My biggest drive to
                continue working towards my engineering goals is that someday,
                I wish to spread the ideals of STEM to my community. The feeling
                you get when you make something all by yourself,  or design
                something that works is the best feeling in the world, and I want
                to share that with as many people as I can. When I was younger,
                I didn't have many opportunities to make things outside of
                arts and crafts, so I want to give others the opportunities that
                I wish I had. My other interests include piano, tennis, and 
                programming.

                &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;I joined robotics because of an
                interest in computer programming
                as a career and I wanted to challenge myself with the
                difficulties that robotics would present. From a young age,
                I've been extremely interested in the workings of computers and
                I enjoy tinkering with code in my free time. I enjoy the logical
                challenges presented by code and the engineering challenges
                presented by robotics. My other hobbies aside from robotics
                include playing basketball, League of Legends,
                piano, and guitar. As head of programming for Stuy Fission 310,
                I am tasked with web design as well as robot programming and
                delegating programmers to do the same.

                &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Hi, I'm Andrew of Team 310, Stuy Fission.
                I like to swim, play
                video games, work out puzzles, and hang out with friends. Ever
                since I was little I've been surrounded by people who like to
                work with their hands, and play with things like Lego. Maybe
                that's a reason why now engineering interests me, and why I
                want to learn more about it. On the team I hope to gain more
                experience and have fun while also learning about design and
                functionality. Building a competition-ready robot with my team
                and seeing it succeed in many ways adds another page in my
                book.

                &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;I loved playing with Lego and
                KNex when I was younger, and still do love toying around
                with them today. As I grew older, I became fascinated with
                machines and engineering. In my middle school, there was
                a club for robotics where we made different things with
                Lego Mindstorms and learned the basics of engineering, but
                we never got to a competitive level. I also want to become
                an engineer when I grow up! All of these reasons are why I
                chose to join Stuy Fission. Being on the team is a very fun
                and educational experience!

                &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;All my life, I've been surrounded
                by computers and technology, but have never really been able
                to learn about their inner workings. When I heard about the
                Stuyvesant robotics team, I found it the perfect opportunity
                to catch up on lost time, learn about engineering, and brush
                up on programming. On the team, I am one of the main
                programmers, and contributed to most of the WaffleBot code.
                In my spare time,  I enjoy playing video games, reading
                (mostly fiction), and playing the violin.

                &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Hello my name's Thomas Ly and 
                I'm a part of Team 310 of Stuyvesant Robotics. As I grew up 
                I was always fascinated by technology and the miracles it 
                could create. As a grew up I found myself wanting to interact 
                with technology and perhaps perform some miracles of my own. A 
                few years ago after reading a few articles about prosthetic 
                limb research I became interested in machinery and many uses 
                that came with it. So when I heard about a club in my high 
                school that focused primarily on building robots I joined in. 
                Now I hope to gain more experience regarding robotics and to 
                achieve great things with my team. Somethings I like  that 
                don't relate to Robotics are gaming, swimming, programming, 
                and reading.
