              &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;FIRST Tech Challenge, or FTC,
              is a high school level competition originally designed to
              help bridge FIRST Lego League and FIRST Robotics
              Competition, allowing students to go from Legos to high
              level robotics more
              smoothly. But now, FTC has become its own competition.
              Building
              one and a half cube feet of robot is not as easy as it
              sounds.
              In September, teams all around the world pick up the game
              manual
              and start working. Given a set list of parts, teams are
              limited
              to using only certain materials for their robot, making
              the
              game harder and more challenging. Fitting mechanisms into
              the
              18' cube isn't easy, but this is what thousands and
              thousands of
              high school teams do from September to March, in order to
              compete in one of the best competitions in the world,
              FIRST
              Tech Challenge.
